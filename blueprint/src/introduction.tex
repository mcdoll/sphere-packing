\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to formalize the proof that the $E_8$ lattice minimizes the density of all $8$-dimensional sphere packings proved by
Maryna Viazovska.

Roughly the proof consists of two steps: the first step is a reduction to finding a function that has certain Fourier theoretic properties, this
reduction was proved by Cohn--Elkies in \cite{tba}.
The second step is to explicitly construct a function in terms of weakly modular forms that possess the desired properties. This second step was Viazovska's contribution and was awarded in 2022 a fields medal.
